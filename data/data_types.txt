_____newCasesBySpecimenDateChange_____
The difference between the number of new cases during the latest 7-day period and the number for the previous, non-overlapping, 7-day period. 
Data are shown by the date the sample was taken from the person being tested.
Data for the most recent days are considered incomplete as it takes time for tests to have an outcome and be recorded on relevant lab systems.


_____newCasesBySpecimenDateChangePercentage_____
The percentage change in the number of new cases during the latest 7-day period, as a percentage of the number for the previous, non-overlapping, 7-day period.
Data are shown by the date the sample was taken from the person being tested.
Data for the most recent days are considered incomplete as it takes time for tests to have an outcome and be recorded on relevant lab systems.
Data are updated Monday to Friday.


_____newCasesBySpecimenDateDirection_____
The direction of the change in the number of new cases during the latest 7-day period compared to the previous, non-overlapping 7-day period.
Data are shown by the date the sample was taken from the person being tested.
Positive changes (shown with an up arrow) mean numbers are increasing.
Negative changes (shown with a down arrow) mean numbers are decreasing.
